# Nonlinear time-dependent leak current in automated patch-clamp platforms


## Prerequisites

This repository requires python3, on a debian-based Linux distribution:
```bash
sudo apt install python3
```

We recommend using a python virtual environment to install the dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

Then "activate" the environment using:
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

Finally, install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip          # Update pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
